- **Operating System**: Windows (primary), Linux, macOS (compatible)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Install Java JDK 8 or higher
2. Ensure JavaFX is available in your Java installation

### Building the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd JavaFX
   ```

2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   javac -cp "lib/*" src/**/*.java
   ```

3. Run the applications:

   **Music Player:**
   ```bash
   java -cp "lib/*:src" app.MusicPlayer
   ```

   **WinShell (CMD Executor):**
   ```bash
   java -cp "lib/*:src" app.WinShell
   ```

   **Chat Application:**
   ```bash
   java -cp "lib/*:src" app.Chat
   ```

## Usage

### Music Player
1. Launch the Music Player application
2. Use the file browser to select music files
3. Control playback using the media controls
4. Switch between loop and sequential play modes
5. Manage your playlist with add/remove functions

### WinShell
1. Launch the WinShell application
2. Enter CMD commands in the input field
3. View real-time command output
4. Execute system commands safely through the GUI
